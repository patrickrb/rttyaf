/**
 * Decides how {@link MicRecorder} reacts when a libusb-direct USB audio capture
 * session ends unexpectedly. Pure logic, no Android types — unit-tested.
 *
 * <p>Answers two questions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Was the session a failure?</b> A session that dies before it can
 *       carry even a fraction of a 15&nbsp;s FT8 cycle is useless <em>even if a
 *       handful of samples arrived first</em>. That is the field failure mode on
 *       a Pixel&nbsp;8 + C-Media adapter (VID:PID {@code 0D8C:0012}): every
 *       libusb session delivered ~100&nbsp;ms of audio and then retired all its
 *       isochronous transfers ({@code code=0}). The old rule counted only
 *       "saw <em>no</em> data at all" as a failure, so that case never tripped
 *       the failure tally and churned a fresh {@code libusb_init}/{@code
 *       libusb_exit} every 2&nbsp;s forever — the waterfall freeze, and the
 *       repeated init/exit that raced libusb into a native SIGSEGV.</li>
 *   <li><b>How long to wait before the next attempt?</b> Exponential backoff so
 *       a persistently-failing device stops hammering the bus (and libusb global
 *       state), capped so a device that recovers is still picked back up. We
 *       never fall back to the phone's built-in microphone: an operator wants
 *       radio audio or none.</li>
 * </ol>
