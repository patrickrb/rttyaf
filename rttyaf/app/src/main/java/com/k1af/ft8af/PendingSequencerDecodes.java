/**
 * Holds deep/late-pass decodes that arrived while a transmission was in
 * progress, so the QSO auto-sequencer can replay them as positive evidence at
 * the first opportunity after key-up.
 *
 * <p>Deep and subtraction-loop passes typically finish 0.5–3&nbsp;s after the
 * slot's fast pass — i.e. right around or after TX keys up. Before this class
 * existed those decodes reached the UI but never the sequencer, so a reply the
 * fast pass missed (found only by a deep pass) left the QSO stalled repeating
 * the previous message. Results that land while transmitting are stashed here
 * and drained by {@code MainViewModel.afterDecode} on the next delivery with TX
 * idle (typically the own-slot fast pass ~1&nbsp;s after key-up), then handed to
 * {@code FT8TransmitSignal.parseMessageToFunction(list, true)}.
 *
 * <p>Entries older than {@link #MAX_AGE_MS} are evicted on every stash/drain:
 * a reply is only evidence for the QSO it belongs to, and after two full
 * cycles the fast pass has since made its own calls — acting on an older
 * stashed report could advance a state it no longer describes. Matching is
 * additionally guarded by the sequencer itself (from/to callsign and slot
 * parity checks), so the age cap is a backstop, not the primary filter.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe: a late full-slot pass delivers from the previous slot's
 * decode thread while the current slot's thread may be delivering its own
 * passes.
