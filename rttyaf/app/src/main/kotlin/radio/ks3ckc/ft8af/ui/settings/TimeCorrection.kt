/**
 * Pure decision/format logic for the manual time-correction control. Kept out of
 * the Composable so it can be unit-tested directly (Compose/DrawScope code can't).
 *
 * The correction is a millisecond offset that drives `UtcTimer.delay`; positive
 * shifts the app's clock forward.
 *
 * The range has to cover the *device clock error*, not FT8's much tighter decode
 * tolerance: a phone that's been offline for a while (no NTP) can drift several
 * seconds, and the correction is what pulls that back toward 0. A field report of
 * a Samsung A50 needing over 3 s while offline is why this is ±5 s, not ±2 s.
