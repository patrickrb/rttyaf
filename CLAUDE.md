## Development environments

Contributors work from two kinds of checkout; the commands differ, so figure
out which one you're on first (`uname` / the primary working directory) and
follow the matching path throughout:

- **Windows** (`<windows-checkout>`, possibly driven from WSL) — uses the
  `cmd.exe /c "gradlew.bat …"` wrapper, which picks up the Android Studio JBR.
- **macOS** (`<mac-checkout>`) — builds and runs unit tests natively
  (`./gradlew …`, needs JDK 17).

Either kind of machine can build, test, install, and drive a real device when
an Android phone is attached over USB debugging (an emulator is often attached
alongside it). The gradle invocation is the main difference (`gradlew.bat`
wrapper vs. `./gradlew` with JDK 17); where a section below gives a command for
one, the other's equivalent is called out inline.

On some devices `screencap` can come back all-black during the splash
animation or when a hardware overlay is active; wait for the app to settle and
retry, and use the accessibility tree only as a fallback (`uiautomator dump`
often can't reach idle because the UI animates continuously).

## Workflow

**Every work item requires a pull request — no direct commits to `main`.**
Even a one-line docs or config change goes through a feature branch and a PR.

**All PRs target `main`.** RTTYAF develops straight to `main` (there is no
`dev`/`staging` promotion chain — that was FT8AF's release discipline and its
gates were removed). Do the work on a feature branch, then
`gh pr create --base main`.

**Use a git worktree for every separate line of work.** Don't switch branches in
your primary checkout — branch-switching there collides with anything else in
flight (a running build, an `adb install`, a different task). Instead spin up an
isolated worktree per task:

```
git worktree add ../<checkout-dir-name>-<short-task-name> -b feat/<task>
```

Notes for a fresh worktree:

- RTTYAF is a pure-Kotlin/JVM app: the RTTY modem lives in
  `rttyaf/app/src/main/kotlin/radio/ks3ckc/ft8af/rtty/` and there are **no
  native (`cpp/`) sources** to copy — a fresh worktree builds as-is. (The
  FT8AF `ft8_lib`/`ft8af_glue` native tree was removed in the fork.)
- Build/install from inside the worktree's `ft8af` dir: Windows uses the wrapper
  (`cmd.exe /c "gradlew.bat installDebug"`); macOS uses `./gradlew` (see Build &
  Deploy for the JDK 17 requirement). Both can install to an attached device.

Remove the worktree when the branch is merged: `git worktree remove <path>`.

When nothing else is in flight in your checkout, a feature branch in place is
fine, but a worktree per task is still the recommended default.

## Testing

**Every new code path requires a new test.** Any branch, helper, or behavior
you add or change must be covered by a unit test in the same PR — this is not
optional, even for small UI helpers.

Compose `@Composable` and `DrawScope` code can't be unit-tested directly, so
extract the decision/geometry logic into a plain top-level `internal` function
or class (e.g. `buildQsoLog`, `QsoPathProjection`) and test that. Keep the
Composable a thin wrapper that just calls the extracted logic.

Tests live in `ft8af/app/src/test/` (Kotlin under `.../kotlin`, Java under
`.../java`), use JUnit4 + Truth (`assertThat`), and add
`@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class)` when the code under test touches
Android/Play-Services types (e.g. anything reaching `MaidenheadGrid`,
`GeneralVariables`, `LatLng`). Pure math/logic needs no runner.

Run from the `ft8af` dir.

**Windows:**

```
cmd.exe /c "gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest"
# or a single class:
cmd.exe /c "gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest --tests <fully.qualified.ClassName>"
```

**macOS** (needs JDK 17 — see Build & Deploy):

```
export JAVA_HOME=<jdk17-home>
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
# or a single class:
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests <fully.qualified.ClassName>
```

## Build & Deploy

After making code changes, always build and install on the connected device
when one is attached.

**Windows:** A WSL shell typically has no Linux JDK, so `./gradlew` fails with
`JAVA_HOME is not set`. Use the Windows wrapper instead — it picks up the Android
Studio JBR automatically:

```
cd ft8af && cmd.exe /c "gradlew.bat installDebug"
```

**macOS:** AGP 8.7.3 / Gradle 8.9 need **JDK 17**; if your system JDK is older,
builds fail without pointing `JAVA_HOME` at a 17. A user-local install (e.g. a
Temurin 17 archive unpacked under your home directory — no sudo needed, unlike
the Homebrew cask) works fine; wherever it lives is your `<jdk17-home>`. The
`installDebug` task installs to *every* attached device (including the
emulator); to target only the phone, build the APK and push it with an explicit
serial:

```
cd ft8af && JAVA_HOME=<jdk17-home> ./gradlew assembleDebug
adb -s <phone-serial> install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

To drive the UI: `adb -s <phone-serial> exec-out screencap -p > shot.png` and
tap with `adb -s <phone-serial> shell input tap <x> <y>` (coordinates in the
device's real pixel space — check it with `adb -s <phone-serial> shell wm size`).

When an emulator is attached alongside the phone, Gradle's install step prints
`TimeoutException`/`Unknown API Level` warnings for the emulator and still
installs on the phone; `Installed on 1 device.` means the phone got the APK, so
ignore the emulator noise.

When multiple devices are attached, target the phone explicitly with `-s` and
its serial (from `adb devices`). If `adb` isn't on your PATH, it lives at
`<android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb` (on Windows
`<android-sdk>\platform-tools\adb.exe`; Homebrew installs on macOS put it at
`/opt/homebrew/bin/adb`).

## Debug logs

The app writes a structured event log to
`/sdcard/Android/data/radio.ks3ckc.ft8af/files/debug.log` via `fileLog()` in
`ComposeMainActivity.kt` — CAT serial sends/recvs, USB attach events,
autoConnect attempts, band/frequency changes, etc. This is usually the most
useful source. Pull it with:

```
adb -s <phone-serial> pull /sdcard/Android/data/radio.ks3ckc.ft8af/files/debug.log /tmp/
```

For runtime detail not in `debug.log` (audio recording loop, system USB events,
crashes), use `adb logcat`. Useful tags: `FT8SignalListener`, `MicRecorder`,
`UsbAudioDevice`, `CableConnector`, `CableSerialPort`, `UsbHostManager`,
`UsbAlsaManager`. The app's `applicationId` is `radio.ks3ckc.ft8af` (the same
for every contributor — it's set in `ft8af/app/build.gradle`) — pid-filter with
`adb -s <phone-serial> logcat --pid=$(adb -s <phone-serial> shell pidof radio.ks3ckc.ft8af)`
when you only want app-internal lines.

## FT8 TX audio pipeline

How a `playFT8Signal` call becomes RF, with the gotchas that produce
audible-but-undecodable signals. Both of these were diagnosed the hard
way and re-introducing either makes TX silently broken — the rig keys,
audio is audible, ALC looks right, and zero spots appear on PSKReporter.

**1. The native library generates the entire waveform.** `GenerateFT8.generateFt8(msg,
freq, 12000)` returns a mono 12.64-second `float[]` at 12 kHz containing the full
FT8 message. The Costas sync arrays at symbols 0-6, 36-42, 72-78 are
embedded by `synth_gfsk` in the native lib — today that's the from-source
`libft8af.so` (`System.loadLibrary("ft8af")`, built from the vendored
`ft8_lib`; historically this was the retired closed prebuilt `libft8cn.so`).
The buffer is correct as generated — everything
downstream just has to *not break it*.

**2. `lateStartSkipMs` clips leading audio, but only if we'd overrun the cycle.**
FT8 audio is 12.64 s; cycle is 15 s; slack is 2.36 s. `msLate` (in
`FT8TransmitSignal.java`) must be computed as
`max(0, time_into_cycle_ms - 2360)` — **not** `time_into_cycle_ms %
15000`. The latter treats every ms past the cycle boundary as lateness,
so a normal on-time TX firing ~500-800 ms into the cycle chops that many
ms off the **start** of the buffer — exactly where the leading Costas
array lives. Receivers see audio but can't sync. Tell from log:
`playLength < samples` when the TX started <2.4 s into the cycle. Fixed
in PR #93.

**3. `libusb_set_iso_packet_lengths` must use the audio rate, not
`wMaxPacketSize`.** A USB Audio Class device plays back exactly the bytes
per frame the host hands it. For USB FS, that's
`(sampleRate * channels * bytesPerSample) / 1000` — e.g. 192 bytes/frame
at 48 kHz stereo 16-bit. The endpoint's `wMaxPacketSize` (~200 for
C-Media CM108-style chips) is the device's *max*, not the data rate.
Sending that much per frame makes the device clock samples ~4 % faster
than negotiated, shifting every FT8 tone up by the same ratio and
pushing the message off WSJT-X's 6.25 Hz grid. Tell from log:
`UsbAudioNative.nativeWrite` returns measurably faster than the audio
duration (12.14 s real time for 12.64 s of audio). Fixed in PR #94 in
`cpp/usb_audio_capture.cpp`. The Android-standard `AudioTrack` path is
unaffected because the kernel UAC driver does this math automatically;
the bug only bites the direct-libusb path used for car-dash kernels and
similar.
